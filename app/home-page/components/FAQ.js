              We don&apos;t focus on the big name stores. We support local
              businesses. There are hundreds and thousands of deli&apos;s
              located in NYC, and each one of them deserves to be featured;
              showcasing their sandwiches and deals. Smart Finder is a map based
              geolocator that allows you to see a variety of sandwiches from the
              comfort of your device, no downloads needed.

              There are thousands of deli&apos;s located in NYC and that number
              will likely continue to grow. We want to focus on local
              businesses, so small deli&apos;s will always be our focus. In
              terms of expansion, it&apos;s a question that will have to be left
              open ended. We are proud of the stores that we have right now but
              if the opportunity arises for us to expand, we will do it.
